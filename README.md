# Principal-Component-Analysis-with-NumPy.

We are going to focus on three learning objectives:

1.Implement Principal Component Analysis (PCA) from scratch with NumPy and Python
2.Conduct basic exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3.Create simple data visualizations with Seaborn and Matplotlib

Will able to implement all the machine learning without using any of the popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and statsmodels so you have a deeper understanding of the fundamentals.
